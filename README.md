Dustcollector-V4.0

Controlling dustcollecting system for multiple machines. 

For every woodworker using lot of stationary machines it is important to remove the dust which is produced by using these machines. When one has many different machines, like table-saw, planer of a thicknesser one needs to connect all these machines. One needs to connect al these machies and includes valves so that only the dust of the machine which is used is collected. To achieve this one needs to include valves. This project allows you to install automatied valves which are controlled by Arduino''s. There is one Arduino for each manche. On them one and the same program can be installed.
